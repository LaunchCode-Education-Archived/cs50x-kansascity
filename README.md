Welcome to cs50x-live-2016.  

##Introduction to Computer Science -CS50x
This course teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science for an experienced and non-experienced audience. In CS50x-live-2016, students will experiment with short bits of "computer code" and bring to life the power and limitations of computers. Everything works within Github, so there is no extra software to download or install. CS50x-live-2016 will provide a general background on computers; no previous experience is required. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. 
##What is Computer Science?
An introduction to discoveries and intellectual paradigms. It requires thinking both in abstract terms and in concrete terms. Designed for students with little or no previous background. Examines theoretical and practical limitations related to unsolvable and intractable computational problems. Ccomputer science has a wide range of specialties that include computer architecture, software systems, graphics, artificial intelligence, computational science, and software engineering. 
##What you'll learn
*	Key foundational concepts in computer science 
*	Build your own versions of web applications
*	A broad and robust understanding of computer science and programming
*	How to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently
*	Youâ€™ll be ready for course concepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and web development
*	Become familiar with a number of languages, including C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML
*	How to develop and present a project to others
* How to think more methodically and to solve problems more effectively

Our goal at LaunchCode is to prepare you to find a job applying Computer Science skills. We look forward to partnering with you through the CS50x-live program.
