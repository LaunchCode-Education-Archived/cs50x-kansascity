### Preseason
|Module | Overview |
| :-------------: |-------------|
| [Module 0](./module0) | This Module introduces you to CS50x and gives you the foundation you’ll need before you start programming. You will be introduced to binary numbers, algorithms, and additional concepts you’ll need to understand to think like a computer programmer. By the end of the module, you will be familiar with pseudocode, and a graphical language called Scratch, which you'll use to complete Problem Set 0. |

### Unit 1: Fundamentals
|Module | Overview |
| :-------------: |-------------|
| [Module 1](./cs50/unit1-fundamentals/module1) | You will write your first lines of code using a programming language called C. To do that, you'll be introduced to CS50's integrated development environment (or "IDE") that you'll use for the remainder of the course. You will also dive more deeply into some of the concepts discussed in Module 0 such as loops, conditionals, and variables - except this time, in code. By the end of this module, you will have completed Problem Set 1.  |
| [Module 2](./cs50/unit1-fundamentals/module2) | You are going to focus on datatypes and typecasting to gain valuable insight. Doesn’t that sound exciting?  These topics will eventually lead you to do some real cryptography (the art of writing or solving secret codes) so you can become a real life codebreaker!! You will create programs to encrypt and decrypt secret messages with user defined functions, array constructs and strings. |
| [Module 3](./cs50/unit1-fundamentals/module3) | You will learn about sorting algorithms and recursion, which will help you discover efficient methods to solving real world problems.  You will also review some of the topics in Modules 1 and 2 to reinforce your knowledge of arrays, debugging and creating functions.  |

### Unit 2 Advanced C
|Module | Overview |
| :-------------: |-------------|
| [Module 4](./cs50/unit2-advanced-c/module4) | You’re halfway through the course! This is the point when you will tackle more advanced concepts in the C programming language.  You will learn about digital forensics, recovering information, pointers, structs (a high-level data structure to define groups of variables) and memory allocation. |
| [Module 5](./cs50/unit2-advanced-c/module5) | You will start off with a review of pointers and memory and then deep dive into other types of data structures that will allow you to develop more complex programs.  There are some limitations to the arrays that you have already learned about and these new data structures will help you to store and manage your data efficiently.  They are called Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Tries and Hash Tables. |

### Unit 3 Web Development
|Module | Overview |
| :-------------: |-------------|
| [Module 6](./cs50/unit3-web/module6) | You are going to transition to Web Programming in this module.  You begin your journey with an introduction to PHP, a programming language often used for web programming. You will also learn about Traceroute, a program that displays the route (or path) that “messages” go through across the Internet. You will also discover the basics of different Internet Protocols that you’ve probably heard about such as HTTP and TCP/IP. We will also go over HTML, the programming language used to create web pages and web servers (used to serve up web pages). |
| [Module 7](./cs50/unit3-web/module7) | You will be deep diving into PHP Syntax, which will lead you to create a web form. You will continue developing web pages using PHP and HTML, while also learning to how to factor out redundant code that can be reused across several of your web pages using the PHP ~include~ statement. The module finishes up with an introduction to SQL, which will be used to display data from databases. |
| [Module 8](./cs50/unit3-web/module8) | TBD |
