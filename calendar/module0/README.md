# Module 0

Please work your way through the following material:

Task | Resource Type| Link | Instructions
--------------|------|------|-------------
Watch | Lecture | <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=zFenJJtAEzE" target="_blank">Week 0</a> | Watch the first lecture! There will be some Harvard-specific information in there (and some information about the class at Yale), so feel free to fast forward through that if you want. 
Read | Lecture Notes| <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/w/notes0w/notes0w.html#binary" target="_blank">Week 1 / Binary</a> | Read over the portion of the notes that talk about binary. Don't worry too much if this doesn't immediately click for you; mostly, it is just good to have an idea of what's going on in the computer at a lower level. <br>Stop when you get to the *Algorithms* header.
Watch | Short| <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacBFrgtQjQ&index=7&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">Binary</a> | Watch this short that will explain binary numbers in more detail.
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/w/notes0w/notes0w.html#algorithms" target="_blank">Week 1 / Algorithms</a> | Read over the notes in the "Algorithms" section, and optionally rewatch this portion of the lecture. Although we aren't writing code yet, this is an important step toward thinking like a programmer. <br>Stop when you get to the *Syllabus* header.
Watch | Lecture | <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=UuFWYOnHwGM" target="_blank">Week 0, continued</a> | Watch the week's second lecture. The class activities, such as the PB & J sandwich exercise, are somewhat silly, but actually do provide a good illustration of how to think like a programmer. There will be some portion of the lecture dedicated to his visit to Yale, so feel free to fast forward through these parts (for example, minutes 25:30-27:30). 
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/f/notes0f/notes0f.html#algorithms" target="_blank">Week 1, continued / Algorithms, PB & J Demonstration</a> | Read over the notes section about Algorithms and the PB & J exercise. <br> Stop when you get to the *Yale Introduction* header.
Watch | Short |  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFLczUUHWNw&index=1&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">Algorithms</a> | Watch this short that explains what an algorithm is, and why this concept is so essential to programming. 
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/f/notes0f/notes0f.html#source_code_and_scratch" target="_blank">Source Code and Scratch</a> | Review these notes from the lecture. This will give you a brief glimpse of the programming language C, and Scratch, which is a graphical language you'll use for Problem Set 0.
Watch | Short | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52JoFF4HMA4&index=41&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">Scratch</a>
1-5 hours | Problem Set | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/0/pset0/pset0.html" target="_blank">Pset0</a> | When you're done, submit your project on Vocareum

TODO add walkthroughs, hello world materials...
