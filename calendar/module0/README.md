# Module 0

### Synopsis
Module 0 is meant to introduce you to CS50x, and to give you the foundation you'll need before you start programming. You'll meet David Malan, the Harvard professor for this class, and some of the teaching fellows (or TFs) from Harvard. They will introduce binary numbers and algorithms, important concepts you'll need to to understand in order to think like a computer programmer. By the end of the module, you will be familiar with pseudocode, and a graphical language called Scratch, which you'll use to complete Problem Set 0. 

You should complete *all* of Module 0 before coming to the first day of class. If you finish this, and have plenty of time to spare, we've included a few more resources that we encourage you to check out before the class begins. 

So without further ado, let the learning begin!

##### Lecture
Task | Resource Type| Link | Instructions
--------------|------|------|-------------
Watch | Lecture | <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=zFenJJtAEzE" target="_blank">Week 0</a> | Your first task is to watch the first lecture! There will be some Harvard-specific information in there (and some information about the class at Yale), so feel free to fast forward through that if you want.

##### Binary
Task | Resource Type| Link | Instructions
--------------|------|------|-------------
Read | Lecture Notes| <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/w/notes0w/notes0w.html#binary" target="_blank">Week 1 / Binary</a> | Read over the portion of the lecture notes that talk about binary. Don't worry too much if this doesn't immediately click for you; mostly, it is just good to have an idea of what's going on in the computer at a lower level. <br>Stop when you get to the *Algorithms* header.
Watch | Short| <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacBFrgtQjQ&index=7&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">Binary</a> | Watch this short that will explain binary numbers in more detail.

##### Algorithms and Pseudocode
Task | Resource Type| Link | Instructions
--------------|------|------|-------------
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/w/notes0w/notes0w.html#algorithms" target="_blank">Week 1 / Algorithms</a> | Read over the notes in the "Algorithms" section, and optionally rewatch this portion of the lecture. Although we aren't writing code yet, this is an important step toward thinking like a programmer. <br>Stop when you get to the *Syllabus* header.
Watch | Lecture | <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=UuFWYOnHwGM" target="_blank">Week 0, continued</a> | Watch the week's second lecture. The class activities, such as the PB & J sandwich exercise, are somewhat silly, but actually do provide a good illustration of how to think like a programmer. There will be some portion of the lecture dedicated to his visit to Yale, so feel free to fast forward through these parts (for example, minutes 25:30-27:30). 
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/f/notes0f/notes0f.html#algorithms" target="_blank">Week 1, continued / Algorithms, PB & J Demonstration</a> | Read over the notes section about Algorithms and the PB & J exercise. <br> Stop when you get to the *Yale Introduction* header.
Watch | Short |  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFLczUUHWNw&index=1&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">Algorithms</a> | Watch this short that explains what an algorithm is, and why this concept is so essential to programming.

##### Scratch
Task | Resource Type| Link | Instructions
--------------|------|------|-------------
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/f/notes0f/notes0f.html#source_code_and_scratch" target="_blank">Source Code and Scratch</a> | Review these notes from the lecture. This will give you a brief glimpse of the programming language C, and Scratch, which is a graphical language you'll use for Problem Set 0.
Watch | Short | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52JoFF4HMA4&index=41&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">Scratch</a>
1-5 hours | Problem Set | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/0/pset0/pset0.html" target="_blank">Pset0</a> | When you're done, submit your project on Vocareum

TODO add walkthroughs, hello world materials...
