# (Fake) Class Project

### The Plan

We will build a project together over the course of the track.

Each day we will do a Studio in which students try to add a new feature onto the project.

After the studio, we will do a demo where the instructor codes up his/her own solution.

The instructor's solution becomes the base code for the next Assignment
