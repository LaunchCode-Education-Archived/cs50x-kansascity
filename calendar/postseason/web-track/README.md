# Web Track! 


topic: front-end focused web development

goal: student should be able to build a project similar to pset 8 (or maybe weather cat+)

project should include a subset of these features:
* interact with an API
* AJAX
* responsiveness
* Bootstrap
* complex user interaction
* overall good UX 
* a rudimentary backend
* a JS framework like Angular


Open Questions:
* How to deal with API keys without a back-end?
* Setup
* How to integrate git with presentation of content?

Setup Environment
* get a text editor (atom, sublime, textmate)
* 

JS Weirdness
* `===` vs `==`
* scope (for example, [this](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud989/lessons/3417188540/concepts/34803486710923))

Pedagogy Ideas
* use dev tools as repl
