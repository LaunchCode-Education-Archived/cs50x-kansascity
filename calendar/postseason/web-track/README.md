# Web Track

### Synopsis

This skill track is a deep-dive into the world of front-end web development.

Over the course of the track, we will build a class project together. Each day for studio, you will add a little bit more onto the project. By the end of the track, you will have built, from scratch, the front end of a website that allows users to keep a running "movie watchlist", so they don't forget all the movies they want to watch. Click here for demo of the finished product: <a href="education.launchcode.org/flicklist" target="_blank"/>FlickList</a>.

Over the course of building this project, you will solidify your comfort with the concepts that were introduced in the Web unit of CS50.
