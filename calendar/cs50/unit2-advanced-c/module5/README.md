### Confusing Stuff
* linked lists and all the other data strctures are all built out of structs and pointers, so as a prerequisite they should be comfortable with those concepts
* malloc vs arrays. Both are pointers to contiguous chunks of memory, so what's the difference?
  * arrays are fixed-size, whereas memory that was `malloc`ed can be `realloc`ed
  * malloc memory comes from the heap, arrays from the ___ (TODO idk)
  * does malloc require all its data to be of the same type? (TODO idk)
* Sometimes I need to free memory, but other times I dont. What gives?
  * you only need to free memory that came from the heap (was `malloc`ed)
  * but what if I didn't call malloc myself, e.g. GetString()? 
    * A better rule of thumb is: anything that's a pointer needs to be freed when youre done. 
* When do I need to malloc something? 
  * Whenever you need memory that will outlast the current function
* hash-tables involve nested data structures, e.g.
  * an array of linked-lists
  * a trie of arrays
