# Studio: Word Grid Stretch

Revenge of the word grid!

Just like last week, this studio involves taking some strings from the user, and then printing them back out in a transformed way.

Today, your program should receive 



```nohighlight
$ ./wordgridstretch Hello Cheez
You word grid currently looks like this:
Hello
Chees

Gimme a stretch factor: 3

Now you have this!
HHHeeellllllooo
HHHeeellllllooo
