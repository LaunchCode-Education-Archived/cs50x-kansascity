# Studio: Word Grid Stretch

Revenge of the word grid!

Just like last week, this studio involves taking some strings from the user, and then printing them back out in a transformed way.

Today, your program should receive 



```nohighlight
$ ./wordgridstretch sun yes ear
You word grid currently looks like this:
sun
yes
ear
Now I will stretch it out. How much should I stretch by?
4
After stretching by 4, you now have this!
ssssuuuunnnn
ssssuuuunnnn
ssssuuuunnnn
ssssuuuunnnn

eeeeaaaarrrr

```
