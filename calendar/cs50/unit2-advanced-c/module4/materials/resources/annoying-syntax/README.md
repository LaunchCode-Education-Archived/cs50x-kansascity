# Resource: Annoying Syntax

Pointers in c have a reputation as being very difficult to learn. But a large part of the difficulty is due to their wacky syntax. 

Here, we attempt to explicitly point out the wackiness, so that hopefully it does not trip you up as much as it might otherwise.

There are two aspects of the syntax that are confusing:

1. The fact that the asterisk `*` symbol has two different (somewhat opposite) meanings, depending on context.
2. The existence of a common convention wherein people often put a space before the asterisk when declaring a pointer type.

Let's look at both of these in more detail.
