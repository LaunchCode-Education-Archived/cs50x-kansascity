# Exercise: Restaurant Menus

Your job here is to write a program that reads in a text file full of menu items, and produces a nice "restaurant menu" on the console, by adding:
* a company slogan (you can make something up)
* a title for the menu. Something awesome like `"MENU:"` 
* each of the menu items should be numbered.

The input files should look like this:

```nohighlight
Turkey Club
Grilled Chicken
Philly Cheesesteak
```
Some example input files are provided in ([exampleMenu.txt](./exampleMenu.html) and [goodBurger.txt](./goodBurger.html)); 

Program usage should look something like this:

```nohighlight
$ ./displayMenu exampleMenu.txt
Welcome to Better Burger, way better than Good Burger!
MENU:
1) Turkey Club
2) Grilled Chicken
3) Philly Cheesesteak
```

We've provided some starter code for you in ([displayMenu.c](./displayMenu.html)), but it's pretty minimal. If you need or want help, the commands and functions that you'll need are discussed in these videos: (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOD2hHiHpn0&index=1&list=PLhQjrBD2T382ZqJSoJqAnX7dXVi5-YaRh" target="_blank">1</a>,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwvObCA04dU&list=PLhQjrBD2T381pcj3Ph49iiDkrhZ9FHpHP" target="_blank">2</a>), so look there first!
