# Restaurant Menus

Write a program that uses a text file of menu items to output a restaurant menu.

We've provided some starter code for you ([here](./displayMenu.c)), but it's honestly very minimal. If you need or want help, the commands and functions you'll need are gone over in these videos: ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOD2hHiHpn0&index=1&list=PLhQjrBD2T382ZqJSoJqAnX7dXVi5-YaRh), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwvObCA04dU&list=PLhQjrBD2T381pcj3Ph49iiDkrhZ9FHpHP)), so look there first!

Example input files are provided ([here](./exampleMenu.txt) or [here](./goodBurger.txt)); input files should look like this:

```
Turkey Club
Grilled Chicken
Philly Cheesesteak
```

Program usage should look like this:

```
$ ./displayMenu exampleMenu.txt
Welcome to Better Burger, way better than Good Burger!
MENU:
1) Turkey Club
2) Grilled Chicken
3) Philly Cheesesteak
```
