# Exercise: Custom strcmp

To practice using pointers, we’ll be implementing our own strcmp function.

Write a function that takes in two `string` variables, and returns `true` if, and only if, the two `strings` are the same.

In your function, make sure you’ve handled the case where the strings don’t have the same length.

We've provided a tiny bit of code to take in two strings and compare them with a function. For this exercise, fill in the body of the `customstrcmp` function.

Here’s an example of a successful implementation for the exercise:
```
$ ./customstrcmp
String 1?: hello
String 2?: world
The strings are not equal!

$ ./customstrcmp
String 1?: hello
String 2?: hello
Bingo! The strings are equal!
```
