# Problem Set: Pset 4

### Synopsis
In this problem set, you'll do (TODO someone: a few sentences, just a quick overview.)

### Guidance
**For Whodunit** - If you are color vision deficient (for example, "red-green color blind"): have someone else review your results each time you try something new! The results of this problem set are often very faint. Therefore, even “trichromats” will likely have difficulty discerning the results.

Don't spend hours trying to get this image PERFECT! If you can see enough to figure out what the results are supposed to be, STOP THERE! Later, if you get frustrated with something else, or need a break from a different problem set, come back to this one for fun. You can do really interesting stuff with this problem, and it's easy to get way too deep into it.

**Whodunit, Resize, and Recover:**
Become an expert on the `xxd` command! This can be very helpful in troubleshooting all three assignments in this problem set. *Play, play, play* with this command's options! Use them to see the byte contents/"RGBTriple" values for the sample images given, such as smiley.bmp and small.bmp. Different size files will need different options in order to view the contents easily. And, notice there's an option that allows you to specify the number of lines to view, so the whole file doesn't scroll on by when you're trying to view its contents!

As always, Zamyla is your friend - AND break your coding into the smallest pieces possible!
* Use Zamyla’s TODO lists as a guide to the parts you need to complete.
* Use the code she shows you! Pay attention to the bits copy.c provides for you, noting the parts Zamyla says you need to alter or add to complete a particular item. Zamyla shows you more than copy.c! You might need to tweak an item for your use, but any actual code she shows you will be useful in solving the problem.
