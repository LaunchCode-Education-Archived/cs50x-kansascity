#### *Glossary*

* **Lecture** : Just watch the video for a lecture. These lectures are very high-level and introductory, without going into a lot of detail. Probably best to grab a snack and crank up the speed to 1.5x *

* **Lecture Bite**: Read over the TA notes from a portion of a lecture, and optionally re-watch the video from that section.

* **Follow-Along**: Follow along with an Instructor as he/she implements a program. As you watch the video, make your own copy of the program. Afterwards, tinker with your copy: break it, fix it, add a tiny feature... basically make some small changes and see what happens.

* **Study**: Work through the interactive material on a page of CS50 Study

* **Resource**: Some sort of additional teaching material or helpful reference material like a cheatsheet. Just check it out and be aware that it's available when you need it.*
