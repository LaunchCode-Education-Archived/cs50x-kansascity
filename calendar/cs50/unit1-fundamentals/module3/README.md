# Module 3

### Outline

* multi-function programs
* multiple files working together
  * .h files 
* arrays
  * syntax for creating
  * syntax for inserting
* the sorting algorithms
* binary search
* time complexity analysis (maybe)
* recursion (maybe)

### Tricky Concepts / Things to Emphasize
* functions: first time theyve seen a program that implements its own functions, rather than just a big fat main()
  * understanding the two different roles: implementation vs invocation 
  * implementation
    * (usually) have to declare the signature
    * return statement
      * terminates execution early 
  * invocation
    * understand that the body of the function is just "sitting there patiently", does not run until your call it from elsewhere
* multiple files: first time the've seen a program composed of multiple files working together
  * .h files for declaring public interface
* creating and writing to arrays
  * have to declare the size first
