# Module 3

### Outline

* the sorting algorithms
* binary search
* time complexity analysis (maybe)
* recursion (maybe)
* multiple files working together
  * .h files 
* continue getting comfortable with
  * arrays
  * functions
* review of a bunch of stuff from previous 2 weeks

### Tricky Concepts / Things to Emphasize

* multiple files: first time the've seen a program composed of multiple files working together
  * .h files for declaring public interface
* creating and writing to arrays
  * have to declare the size first
* functions (TODO they actually have seen this stuff the prevous week, so re-look over the below:)
  * first time theyve seen a program that implements its own functions, rather than just a big fat main()
  * understanding the two different roles: implementation vs invocation 
  * implementation
    * (usually) have to declare the signature
    * return statement
      * terminates execution early 
  * invocation
    * understand that the body of the function is just "sitting there patiently", does not run until your call it from elsewhere
