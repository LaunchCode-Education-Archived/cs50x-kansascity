### Outline

Class # | Before Class | During Class | Topics / Skills
--------|--------------|--------------|----------------
Class 1 | [Class 1 Prep Work](./materials/class1-prep) | [Class 1](./materials/class1) | sorting algorithms, time complxity analysis, module1 review, more practice with arrays, more debugging
Class 2 | [Class 2 Prep Work](./materials/class2-prep), start [Pset3](TODO) | [Class 2](./materials/class2) | recursion, merge sort, module2 review, more practice with functions, multiple files working together
Class 3 | continue [Pset3](TODO) | [Class 3](./materials/class3) | (office hours)

### Tricky Concepts / Things to Emphasize

* multiple files: first time the've seen a program composed of multiple files working together
  * .h files for declaring public interface
* creating and writing to arrays
  * have to declare the size first
* functions (TODO they actually have seen this stuff the prevous week, so re-look over the below:)
  * first time theyve seen a program that implements its own functions, rather than just a big fat main()
  * understanding the two different roles: implementation vs invocation 
  * implementation
    * (usually) have to declare the signature
    * return statement
      * terminates execution early 
  * invocation
    * understand that the body of the function is just "sitting there patiently", does not run until your call it from elsewhere
