### Steps

Class # | Before Class | During Class | Topics / Skills
:--------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|----------------
**Class 1** | [Prep Work](./materials/class1-prep) | [In Class](./materials/class1) | sorting algorithms, time complexity analysis, module1 review, more practice with functions
**Class 2** | [Prep Work](./materials/class2-prep), Start [Pset3](./materials/problem-set) | [In Class](./materials/class2) | recursion, merge sort, module2 review, more debugging, compiling, multiple files working together
**Class 3** | Continue [Pset3](./materials/problem-set) | [In Class](./materials/class3) | (office hours)

### Tricky Concepts / Things to Emphasize

* multiple files: first time the've seen a program composed of multiple files working together
  * .h files for declaring public interface
* creating and writing to arrays
  * have to declare the size first
* functions (TODO they actually have seen this stuff the prevous week, so re-look over the below:)
  * first time theyve seen a program that implements its own functions, rather than just a big fat main()
  * understanding the two different roles: implementation vs invocation 
  * implementation
    * (usually) have to declare the signature
    * return statement
      * terminates execution early 
  * invocation
    * understand that the body of the function is just "sitting there patiently", does not run until your call it from elsewhere
