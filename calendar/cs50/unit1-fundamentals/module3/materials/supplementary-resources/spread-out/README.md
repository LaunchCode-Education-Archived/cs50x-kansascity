# Example: Spread Out

So far we've only been working with small programs in which all the source code lives together in a single file, 
`myprogram.c`. But as we start writing larger, more complex programs, cramming everything into one file can make
it hard to stay organized. 

We saw a similar process in Module 2 with functional decomposition. Just as we learned to decompose a 
large main function into several smaller, reusable functions, we also can (and should) do a similar decomposition 
procedure at the level of files. 

Here we provide an example of how to do this.

TODO Make the example. Provide an old version, and then a new, refactored version.
