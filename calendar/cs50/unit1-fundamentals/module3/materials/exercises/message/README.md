##### Module 3

# Exercise: Message

Check out <a href="message.c" target="_blank">message.c</a>, the beginnings of a program that will allow the user to 
"send a message" to someone, like so:
```
$ ./message
Name of sender: Count Chocula
Name of recipient: Count Vanilla
Message: I like you.

Dear Count Vanilla,

I like you.

Sincerely, 
Count Chocula
```

Notice line 18, in which we call the function `printMessage`, which does all the work of printing the stuff to the console. 
Sounds great, except that `printMessage` does not exist yet. That's your job! 

Start by just thinking about the signature of the function. 
* How many input paramters does it take?
* What are the types of those paramters?
* What are some good names to give those parameters?
* What should the return type be?


If you're stuck, I've written the answers at the bottom of this very long page. Scroll down.
