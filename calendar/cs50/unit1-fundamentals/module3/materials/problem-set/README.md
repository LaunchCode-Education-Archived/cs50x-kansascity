# Problem Set: Pset 3

### Synopsis
In this problem set, you'll do (TODO someone: a few sentences, just a quick overview.)

### Guidance
While searching and sorting, you will be getting more experienced with arrays. You're also gaining experience reading and figuring out how someone else's code works! (This is a good example of why something like `style50` standards are a good thing to use with your own code.)

Make sure you *break your work into the smallest pieces you possibly can*! Do *one thing at a time*, and *make sure it's working before going on to something else*.

CS50 pre-codes function prototypes for you in this pset. So, start by doing a `printf()` to see what values are being provided to a function you're currently working on. Once you see the values and understand what you're getting, create your search/sort plan. If you have a `for` loop, `printf()` the values of your loop variables before writing code to use them. When you have an `if` statement, `printf()` to determine whether the `if` is being processed (or its companion `else`, if there is one). Once you make sure the tiniest thing works, remove that bit of test code, and write the next little step in your plan.

In Game of Fifteen, you will have array overload! You will be using a multi-dimensional array, so instead of just one row of data, you'll have rows and columns.
* Use meaningful names for your loop variables! Which represents a row versus a column, `i` or `j`? Use `row` and `col` instead (or `col` and `row`), and you wonâ€™t have to wonder while you're troubleshooting.
* Use the trusty "swap" code you've learned for arrays to move your tiles about.
