# Problem Set: Pset 3

### Synopsis
In this problem set, you'll do (TODO someone: a few sentences, just a quick overview.)

### Guidance
While searching and sorting, you will be getting more experienced with arrays. You're also gaining experience reading and figuring out how someone else's code works! (This is a good example of why something like `style50` standards are a good thing to use with your own code.)

In Game of Fifteen, you will have array overload! You will be using a multi-dimensional array, so instead of just one row of data, you'll have rows and columns.
* Use meaningful names for your loop variables! Which represents a row versus a column, `i` or `j`? Use `row` and `col` instead (or `col` and `row`), and you wonâ€™t have to wonder while you're troubleshooting.
* Use the trusty "swap" code you've learned for arrays to move your tiles about.
