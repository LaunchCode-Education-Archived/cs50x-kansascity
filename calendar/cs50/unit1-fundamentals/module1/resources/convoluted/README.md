# Convoluted

Variables can help us avoid writing overly complicated one-liners of convoluted code.

Use variables to break your code up into clean, manageable steps spread over multiple lines.

Good code == **readable** code

Variables also help us to avoid repeating ourselves. If you find yourself writing the same 
expression more than once, you should think about defining a variable to hold that expression.

Check out [convoluted.c](./convoluted.c) for an example.
