### Steps

Class # | Before Class | During Class | Topics/Skills
:--------:|:------------:|:------------:|-----------------------|
**Class 1**| [Prep Work](./materials/class1-prep) | [In Class](./materials/class1) | CS50 IDE setup, printf, math, intro to libraries|
**Class 2**| [Prep Work](./materials/class2-prep) | [In Class](./materials/class2) | conditions, loops, variables, assignment vs equality|
**Class 3**| [Prep Work](./materials/class3-prep) | [In Class](./materials/class3) | validating input, typecasting, nesting control flow, functions, debugging!|

### Outline 
(notes to ourselves. can become cleaner and front-facing if we want)

##### Class 1
* basic set up
* printf
* user input
* math
  * order of ops 
  * types
  * integer division
* a little bit of compilation, libraries
  * #include <stdio> for printf <cs50.h> for GetString()
  
##### Class 2
* conditions
  * different types and syntax of each
  * when to use which
  * boolean exprs
* loops
  * different types and syntax of each
  * when to use which
* assignment vs equality 
* calling a function like atoi()
* variables

##### Class 3
* validating input
* typecasting
* nesting control flow
* more on functions
* debugging! using print statements (and possibly the GUI debugger)

### Instructor Guide 
(TODO move to separate REPO)

#### Tricky Concepts / Things to Emphasize:
* assignment vs equality
* nesting control flow
  * specifically for validating input, and for Mario where you need a for-loop within a for-loop
* weirdness with types
  * integer division
  * casting
* calling a function, making sure types line up
* How to debug!
