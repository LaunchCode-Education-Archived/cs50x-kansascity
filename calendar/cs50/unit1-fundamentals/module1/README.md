### Outline 
(notes to ourselves. can become cleaner and front-facing if we want)

##### Class 1
* basic set up
* printf
* user input
* math
  * order of ops 
  * types
  * integer division
* a little bit of compilation, libraries
  * #include <stdio> for printf <cs50.h> for GetString()
  
##### Class 2
* conditions
  * different types and syntax of each
  * when to use which
  * boolean exprs
* loops
  * different types and syntax of each
  * when to use which
* assignment vs equality 
* calling a function like atoi()
* variables

##### Class 3
* validating input
* typecasting
* nesting control flow
* more on functions
* debugging! using print statements (and possibly the GUI debugger)

***
### Instructor Guide 
(TODO move to separate REPO)

#### Tricky Concepts / Things to Emphasize:
* assignment vs equality
* nesting control flow
  * specifically for validating input, and for Mario where you need a for-loop within a for-loop
* weirdness with types
  * integer division
  * casting
* calling a function, making sure types line up
* How to debug!

#### *Glossary*
*TODO move this to "Module 0"*

* **Lecture** : Just watch the video for a lecture. These lectures are very high-level and introductory, without going into a lot of detail. Probably best to grab a snack and crank up the speed to 1.5x *

* **Lecture Bite**: Read over the TA notes from a portion of a lecture, and optionally re-watch the video from that section.

* **Follow-Along**: Follow along with an Instructor as he/she implements a program. As you watch the video, make your own copy of the program. Afterwards, tinker with your copy: break it, fix it, add a tiny feature... basically make some small changes and see what happens.

* **Study**: Work through the interactive material on a page of CS50 Study

* **Resource**: Some sort of additional teaching material or helpful reference material like a cheatsheet. Just check it out and be aware that it's available when you need it.*
