# Studio: Lovely Rect<3ngle

Write a program that "draws" a rectangle made of hearts `<3` on the console. 
Your program should prompt the user for a width and a height, and then print the corresponding rectangle:

```
$ ./rectangle
Width: 8
Height: 3
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
```
