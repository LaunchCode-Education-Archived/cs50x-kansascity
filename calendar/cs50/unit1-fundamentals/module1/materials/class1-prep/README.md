-----|---------------|------|-------------
Watch | Lecture | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YiiHNiSfmKI?autoplay=1&rel=0&start=0" target="_blank">Week 1</a> | Watch the lecture video, which will give you a high-level introduction to this week's concepts. If you want, consider increasing the speed to 1.5x (only available in some browsers). The material will be covered in finer detail later. <br> Also, you can skip the portion of the video between 4:36-6:30 if you don't want to watch David Malan talk about information only relevant to Harvard students.

This will compare what we did in Scratch to code in C. <br>Stop at the *CS50 IDE* header (or just keep going, because the next task is to read that. See below for when to stop next). 
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/1/w/notes1w/notes1w.html#cs50_ide" target="_blank">Week 1 / cs50 IDE</a> | Read over the notes for the "CS50 IDE" section. This introduces you to the environment where we'll be writing code throughout the course. <br>Stop at the *Writing Code* header.

Follow those instructions so you can start coding! <br> Stop at the *Hello, C* header (or just keep going, because the next task is to do that. See below for when to stop next). 
Hello World! | Problem Set | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/1/pset1/pset1.html#hello_c" target="_blank">Hello, World</a> | Now that you've got your IDE set up, go ahead and continue onto the next section of Pset1, which will walk you through writing a *Hello, World* program. You'll also learn about the Check50 code, which you can use to see if your CS50 assignments are correct. <br>Stop when you get to the section titled *Shorts*.
Watch | Doug's Playlist | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poT5Yd0Ag8I&list=PLhQjrBD2T38117CFyiIB9x4NOR6979YwA&index=1" target="_blank">Command-Line</a> | Watch the video from Doug's Playlist called *Command-Line*. This will introduce you to, you guessed it, the command-line!
