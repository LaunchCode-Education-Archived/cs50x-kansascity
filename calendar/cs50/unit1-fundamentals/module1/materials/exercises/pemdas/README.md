# Exercise: Marathon time

We've given you some starter code that is supposed to:
- ask the user how many miles they've run
- ask how many hours they've spent running it

And tells them:
- how many more hours they would need to finish a marathon at their current pace

...But there's a bug in the code!  Fix the code so it returns the correct amount of time left.

An example run of the corrected code:
```
$. marathon
How many miles have you run so far? 5
How many hours ago did you start? 2
At this rate, you have 8.480000 hours left.
```
