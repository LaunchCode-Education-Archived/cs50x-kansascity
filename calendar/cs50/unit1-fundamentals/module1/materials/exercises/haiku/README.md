# Exercise: Haiku

### Introduction

Welcome to your first exercise! A few quick instructions on how to do one of these things:
1. Open up your CS50 IDE and log in.
2. Inside the IDE, open up a new Terminal Window
3. Inside the terminal, make a new directory called `module1`:
```
$ mkdir module3
```

### 


In your CS50 IDE, write a program named `haiku.c` that prints a 3-line Haiku to the console, like this:
```
$ ./haiku
Learning how to code
is a thing I like to do
more often than not
```
Make up your own haiku, if feeling creative.
