#Exercise: Haiku

In your CS50 IDE, write a program named `haiku.c` that prints a 3-line Haiku to the console, like this:

$ ./haiku
```
Learning how to code
is a thing I like to do
more often than not
```
Make up your own haiku, if feeling creative. You're even allowed to talk bad about coding.
