For homework you should have done: [Prep for Class 2](../class2-prep)

### Today

In class we'll review some of the important concepts covered in the prep for today, including loops, conditions, and functions. There will be two studios today that will emphasize those concepts, and should help ultimately help you with the next part of the problem set (Mario). 

1. Q&A on the following topics
 * conditions
 * loops 
 * nesting control flow
 * functions
 * How to debug!


2. Studios:
  * [Guess](../studios/guess)
  * [Lovely Rectangle](../studios/rectangle)

### Homework
* Try to finish <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/1/pset1/pset1.html#itsa_mario" target="_blank">Problem Set 1: Mario</a>
* There is no "prep work" before the next class, so work on the problem set and come to [Class 3!](../class3)
