##### Unit1: Fundamentals
# Notes to Self

##### Random crap that needs to be mentioned somewhere:
* `++` operator (and `--`)
* `+=` operator (and `-=`, `*=`, etc)

##### Guidance for TFs
* If a student asks for help with their code, you are not just providing the answer, but also serving as a model for how someone should debug. So try to externalize your thought process as much as possible as you walk through the problem. Don't just tell them they should have initialized their variable outside the loop on line 16; have them step through their program in the debugger (or with print statements) and see how the variable gets re-clobbered on each iteration.
