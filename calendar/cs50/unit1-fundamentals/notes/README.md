##### Unit1: Fundamentals
# Notes to Self

##### Random crap that needs to be mentioned somewhere:
* `++` operator (and `--`)
* `+=` operator (and `-=`, `*=`, etc)

##### Out of order resources
week1 walkthrough sizeof
week2 lecture notees function decomposition
week2 other stuff on functions

##### Guidance for TFs
* If a student asks for help with their code, you are not just providing the answer, but also serving as a model for how someone should debug. So try to externalize and walk them through your thought process as much as possible. E.g. don't just tell them they should have initialized their variable outside the loop on line 16; have them step through their program in the debugger (or with print statements) and see how the variable gets re-clobbered on each iteration. Teach them "how to fish"
