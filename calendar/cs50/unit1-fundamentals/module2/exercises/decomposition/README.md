# Exercise: Decomposition

*TODO an exercise that requires them to "decompose" a cluttered program with a long `main` function by pulling
some piece of the funcitonality (especially something that is repeated) out into a separate function. Potentially
use their code from [letterlocator](../letterlocator) as the starting point.*
