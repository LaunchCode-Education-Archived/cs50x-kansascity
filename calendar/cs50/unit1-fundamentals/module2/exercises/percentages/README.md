##### Module 2

# Percent

Write a program that prompts the user for two positive integers: a numerator and a denominator, and prints the fraction as a percent. 

```
$ ./percent
non-negative numerator: 2
non-negative denominator: 3
66.67%
```

*TODO split this into two parts, first without the pretty 2-decimal-place formatting, then with it.*
