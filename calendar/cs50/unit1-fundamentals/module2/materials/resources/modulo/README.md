# Resource: Modulo

Recall that the modulo operator `%` returns the remainder when one number is divided by another.

For example:

`6 % 4 = 2`

`3 % 2 = 1`

`15 % 3 = 0`

The modulo is used a lot in computer science, but here's a simple example. In [divisibleby7.c](./divisibleby7.html), there's a simple program that says if a number, given by the user, is divisible by 7, like so:

```nohighlight
$ ./divisibleby7
Give me a number: 11
That number is not divisible by 7, chief!

$ ./divisibleby7
Give me a number: 21
That number is divisible by 7, friend!
```
