The modulo operation returns the remainder of one number divided by another.

For example:
6 % 4 = 2
3 % 2 = 1
4 % 1 = 0
15 % 3 = 0

The modulo is used a lot in computer science, including the quintessential interview question, FizzBuzz.

For the numbers 1 through 100, print Fizz if it is divisible by 3, print Buzz if it is divisible by 5, and print FizzBuzz if it is divisible by both. Otherwise, print the number.
