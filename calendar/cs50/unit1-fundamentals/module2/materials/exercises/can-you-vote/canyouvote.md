```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

// This exercise is very similar to the example in the "ages" video on cs50; if you need help, look there first!

int main(void)
{
    // Ask the user how many people to check

    // Ask for each person's age, and store it

    // Output if each person can vote or not (they can vote if they're 18 or older!)

}
```
