# Exercise: Can You Vote?
Help the user figure out if their friends can vote!  For the purposes of the exercise, someone can vote as long as they are 18 or older.

We want the user to tell us:
- how many people to check

Then prompt the user for each age one-by-one.  After that, for each person, we’ll output if they can vote or not (if they’re at least 18 or not).

Basic template code is provided [here.](https://github.com/Launch-Code/cs50x-live-2016/blob/master/calendar/cs50/unit1-fundamentals/module2/materials/exercises/array-read/canyouvote.c)

This exercise is very similar to the one in this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYVU9nFYybU&list=PLhQjrBD2T380sc-fXwl1sviA-twxFduVU); if you need help, look there first!
