##### Module 2

# Exercise: How Maneee

[howmaneee.c](howmaneee.c) is a program that is supposed to count the occurrances of the letter 'e'
in a string provided by the user:
```
$ ./howmaneee
Type some stuff: Why hello there
The thing you just typed contains 3 'e's!
```

Unfortunately, there's something wrong with it. See if you can spot the bug and fix it.
