# Exercise: String with Indexes

Write a program that receives a string from the user, and then loops over the string and prints each character
along with the index of that character, like so:

```
$ ./stringindexes
Give me a string please: Bagel
The character at index 0 is B
The character at index 1 is a
The character at index 2 is g
The character at index 3 is e
The character at index 4 is l
```
