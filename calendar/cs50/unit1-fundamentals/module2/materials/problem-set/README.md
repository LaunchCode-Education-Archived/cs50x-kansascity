# Problem Set 2 

### Synopsis
Zhofrph wr Sureohp Vhw 2! Whoops, forgot to decrypt myself there... Welcome to Problem Set 2!

In this problem set, you'll use what you've learned so far to dabble in some cryptography. To do this, you'll be introduced to some ciphers, which are codes used to encrypt messages. 


### Guidance

There are a couple extra shorts that you may find useful to watch:

### How to submit 
FILE NAMES: initials.c, caesar.c, vigenere.c

INSTRUCTIONS: Submit your assignments on Vocareum. After signing in, you will see each component as an assignment on the left. You must submit each component separately. Follow the instructions there, and make sure you name your files correctly!

If you are forget how to use Vocaruem, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19HIMxU_RtVV0PcGpuL71KmAoQh-KTgyPGpWWLcmwo58/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Student Guide</a> section about Vocaruem.
