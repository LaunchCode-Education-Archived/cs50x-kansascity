TODO | Exercise | [Exercise: Percent](TODO move from module 1) |  
TODO | Read | [Resource: Chars](../resources/Chars) | TODO briefly introduce the `char` type, and explain that strings we've seen so far are just a sequences of chars.
TODO | Read | [Resource: Three Letter Word](resources/threeletterword) | TODO an exmaple program that asks for three letters, one `char` at a time, and then prints "That spells %c%c%c!"
TODO | Read | [Lecture Notes: Week 2 / Typecasting](http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/2/m/notes2m/notes2m.html#typecasting)
TODO | Follow-Along | [walkthroughs/ascii-0](TODO), [walkthroughs/ascii-1](TODO) | Note: Talks about equivalence between chars and ints. typecasting is a prereq.

#### Functions:
Time Estimate | Task | Link | Instructions
--------------|------|------|-------------
TODO | Read | [Resource: Calling Functions](../resources/callingfunctions) | TODO res: review of how to call a library function. Understanding return value vs side effect.
TODO | Do Exercise | [Exercise: atoi](../exercises/atoi) | TODO exc: make them use atoi function
TODO | Read | [Resource: Creating Functions](../resources/creatingfunctions) | TODO res: explain that in addition to using other people's functions like `printf` and `atoi`, we can also write our own. 
TODO | Follow-Along | [walkthroughs/functions-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zoRoz8Pq4E&list=PLhQjrBD2T380sc-fXwl1sviA-twxFduVU&index=13), [walkthroughs/functions-1](TODO)
TODO | Resource | [Resource: Step Through](../resources.stepthrough) | TODO res: give a detailed picture of the ORDER in which code gets executed when you call a subroutine. Ideally use the debugger. Otherwise use print statements and maybe draw a picture / video
20 mins | Watch | [Doug's Playlist / Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtuMIHebSu8&list=PLhQjrBD2T383cKxax1sP6rKA3Q1JGrgcE&index=2)
TODO | Do Exercise | [Exercise: Next Num](../exercises/nextnum) | TODO exc: have them refactor a program that computes the next number after an input value, by pulling functionality out of main and into a function with signature `int successor(int n)`
TODO | Watch Video | [shorts/Return Values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gziiOF0uIX8&index=6&list=PLhQjrBD2T381wyZt81eGNZuZ4rzOos-AF) | TODO: Potentially scrap this. Somewhat confusingly presented-- `void` as "simplest return type", and last example uses file i/o, which will be scary and unfamiliar.
TODO | Read | [Resource: Return Values](../resources/returnvalues) | TODO res: give picture of return values as evaluating a statement.

TODO | Read | [Resource: Scope](../resources/scope) | TODO res: buggy program with loop, need to pull out the variable to higher scope
