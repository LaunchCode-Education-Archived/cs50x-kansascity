# Exercise: Hello Sessions

Let's make another Hello site. 

This time, we will (almost) never have to worry about the user leaving a form field blank, because if they do, we will just use Sessions to remember what they said last time! 

### Starter Code

As usual, [hello-form.php](./hello-form.html) is already done. It simply contains a form askingthe user for their name (We don't care about customizing the greeting this time).

And as usual [hello-response](./hello-response.html) is partially done, but contains 3 TODOs!
