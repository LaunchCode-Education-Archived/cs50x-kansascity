# Exercise: Hello 2

Let's improve our Hello site by providing some guidance if the user fails to fill out their form correctly, just like David does in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csboq6ZtqkI&index=6&list=PLhQjrBD2T381f7IlC090UL9JN-PJfGoLd">froshims-2</a> walkthrough.

### Starter Code

As usual, copy over [hello-form.php](./hello-form.html) and [hello-response.php](./hello-response.html) into your IDE in a new folder for this exercise. 

### Assignment

Just like last time, the form is already done, but `hello-response.php` has 3 TODOs. The TODOs should be pretty self explanatory here. Just fill them in, using the walkthrough video above as guidance.
