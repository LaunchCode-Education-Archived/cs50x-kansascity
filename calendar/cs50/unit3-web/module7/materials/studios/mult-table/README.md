# Studio: Mult Table

For today's studio, we are going to borrow an exercise that Doug Lloyd suggested in his *PHP for Web Development* video. Thanks Doug!

### Starter Code

As Doug said, your assignment is to create a pair of PHP files, `mult_form.php` and `mult_table.php`.

We've already done most of `mult_form.php` for you here: <a href="./mult_form.html" target="_blank">mult_form.php</a>
