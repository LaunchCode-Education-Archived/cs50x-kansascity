# Studio: Mult Table

For today's studio, we are going to borrow an exercise that Doug Lloyd suggested in his *PHP for Web Development* video. Thanks Doug!

### Starter Code

As Doug says, your assignment is to create a pair of PHP files, `mult_form.php` and `mult_table.php`. The form should contain one field for the user to enter a number. When the form is submitted, the user should be taken to the other page, which displays an `n by n` mulitplication table.

We've already started both files. Copy <a href="./mult_form.html" target="_blank">mult_form.php</a> and <a href="./mult_form.html" target="_blank">mult_form.php</a> into your IDE.

The form is almost done. There is one thing missing! If you don't spot it right away, it should become clear once you get started.

Over in `mult_table.php`, you have some TODOs. We have placed some basic skeleten code to create the `<table>`, but currently the result is simply 10 rows of `#` characters.

For a refresher on how the `<table>` tag works, here is a good reference with some examples: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp
