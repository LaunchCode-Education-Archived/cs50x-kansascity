# Studio: Validate

TODO 
form validation similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eViManaIKkQ&index=9&list=PLhQjrBD2T382FjybRNOXyEdsjP9CNKJgb" target="_blank">Walkthroughs</a>, but with a nicer error message. Rather than using an alert, manipulate the DOM so that the message is an annotation next the element that needs fixing. Maybe also outline that element in red or something.
