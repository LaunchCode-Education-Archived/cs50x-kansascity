# Studio: AJAXson 5

One of the classic problems in computer science is the question of how to optimally implement a web page that displays GIFs of the Jackson 5. Today we'll take a stab at it.

### The Goal

Your site should provide the user with a form where she can type a search query:

<img src="screenshots/blank.png"/>

Upon submitting the form, the user should briefly see an indication that something awesome is about to happen:

<img src="screenshots/loading.png"/>

After a quick second, a GIF should appear!

<img src="screenshots/moonwalk.png"/>

If the user clicks the button again, even with the same search term, they should see a new GIF:

<img src="screenshots/cowboy.png"/>

The gif should ideally be relevant to both the search term and the Jackson 5 (or at least Michael), but depending on the search term you might find that only one or the other could be satisfied. For example, click number 3 might yield this:

<img src="screenshots/mariodance.png"/>

Dance: check. Jackson: not so much.
