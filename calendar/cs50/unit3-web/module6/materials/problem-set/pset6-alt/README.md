# Problem Set 6 (Alternative)

TODO

Something involving cURL and HTML!

Should reinforce the material covered in the 
<a href="../../class1-prep" target="_blank">prep</a>
<a href="../../class2-prep" target="_blank">work</a>.

Should require 5+ hours of work for most students.

## The Notes for the cURL part

#### The Workflow

The flow for the curl part of the PSET should be this:

1. Intro the part of the HTTP protocol that we want to talk about
2. Translate that to curl invocation
3. Execute the command, and have students look at stdout from terminal and from browser

#### The Activities

I have a couple of suggestions of possible APIs to interact with, here are a few:

- [SWAPI](swapi.co) GET only, no auth
- [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
- [WikiMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php)
- Google Search
- Slack??
- Twitter??

Because we are going to focus on HTML and CSS in this PSET, I suggest that we focus on
the services that return HTML instead of JSON.
