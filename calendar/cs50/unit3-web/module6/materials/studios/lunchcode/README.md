##### Module 6 

[Back to Class 2](../../class2)
 
# Studio: LunchCode

Today we are going to be working once again with CS50's API, specifically the Food API.

Your assignment for today is to build a front end page for users to query the API.

Here is a mockup of what you are trying to build:

<img src=lunchcode1.png/>

As you can see, the page contains three `<form>` elements, one for each of the three "endpoints" of the food API: `/facts`, `/menus`, and `/recipes`.

Upon filling out one of the forms and clicking its `SEND REQUEST` button, a user should be whisked away to the page displaying the response from the API, like this:

<img src="lunchcode2.png"/>



TODO another mockup assignment like the <a href="../../exercises/favorite-websites" target="_blank">Favorite Websites</a> exercise, but with CSS as well.
