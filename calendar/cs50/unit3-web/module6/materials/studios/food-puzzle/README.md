# Studio: Food Puzzle

The CS50 staff have created a few APIs that are available for students to play with. They have:
* **Courses API** for courses offered at Harvard
* **Food API** for meals served at Harvard
* **Maps API** for map data about Harvard's campus

We are going to use the Food API to solve a puzzle!

### Setting Up

*Explain about needing API key, walk them through that process*

You'll notice that you need an "API key" in order to proceed.
