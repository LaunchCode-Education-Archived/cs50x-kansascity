Watch | Lecture | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWxwYbaAWxs" target="_blank">Week 6</a> | David travels to Yale to deliver this lecture. The first portion of the video (until 3:37) has unrelated announcements, as does minutes 14:00-15:44, so feel free to fast forward through those. You'll also review some portion of the video that you should have seen during the previous Module. The rest of the lecture is dedicated to our transition to web programming (exciting!).
