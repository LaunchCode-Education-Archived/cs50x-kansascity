# How to take this class

TODO: Build up from **What is CS50?** to **What is CS50x (on edX)?** to **What is CS50x Live (with LaunchCode)?**

##Welcome to LaunchCode’s CS50x! 

###What is CS50x?

CS50 is Harvard’s Introduction to Programming class for non-CS majors. CS50x is a free online version of the class offered through edX, a MOOC formed by Harvard and MIT. LaunchCode’s CS50x is an in-person version of CS50x with mentored support, curated content, additional exercises, and supplemental skill tracks. 

We’ve made the curriculum for this class available for you here on Github. Of course, the CS50x class itself and course materials are available for free through edX. The curriculum here is meant to guide you through those resources. Based off our previous experience offering this class, we have compiled and ordered the resources to best help you learn and digest the concepts and skills you need to know in order to succeed in this course. We’ve also developed our own additional exercises and activities that help reinforce those skills. But instead of adding extra work, these additional exercises should help you move through the problem sets and assignments more quickly. 

Before you start with the course materials, we highly encourage you to read the information here. Our curriculum uses specific terms that instruct you on how to complete that task. Eventually, this will become second nature, but in the beginning you may have to refer back to this section to make sure you know what to do. 


###Understanding the course calendar

In CS50x, there are 9 assignments, called “problem sets.” We’ve broken down this course into Modules, which correspond to each problem set assignment in CS50x. Each Module contains 3 class periods. Before each class period, there is “Prep Work” that you should complete before that class. The Prep Work will make sure you get the most out of each class period.

Prep Work is broken down into specific tasks that are ordered chronologically. Students should complete the tasks in order, following the directions given by the task name, and the instructions to the right. As an example, here is a screenshot of a Prep Work from Module 1:

Tasks are given specific names, which tell you (the student) how you should complete that task. Below is a glossary of those task names, and what they mean:

###Task Glossary
* **Follow-Along**: Follow along with an instructor as he/she implements a program. As you watch the video, type your own personal copy of the program. 
* **Exercise**: A short exercise students should complete that will help reinforce a specific concept or skill.
* **Watch Video**: These are lectures, shorts, and other types of videos that will go over specific topics. 
* **Read**: These tasks most commonly ask students to read notes from a portion of a lecture, or an additional resource.

###In Class
Class sessions will be used to do group work, review concepts, and to get questions answered while working through the week’s assignment. 

In most class sessions, students will work on **studios**. Studios are specially designed exercises that are meant to focus on important skills and concepts relevant to that week. These are smaller than problem sets, intended to be completed during the class period, and should ultimately help students complete their problem sets. Students should work on studios in small groups of 3-4 students, unless instructed otherwise. 
 
There will also be **Q&A** during class sessions. The course instructor will answer questions from students that are related to that week’s topics. This time is meant to address general problems that can help most students, and is not intended to be used to solve specific student problems. 

Every class session will also have time dedicated to **office hours**. This is unstructured time where students should work on the week’s assignment. Mentors, TFs, and instructors will be available to answer specific questions. 

The typical class structure within a Module is to have studio and Q&A for the first two classes, and office hours for the third class (and fun for all 3!).

###How to Succeed in this Class
1. Make sure you complete the Prep Work before each class. This is essential to make sure you get the most out of the in-person class sessions. We’d rather you do the prep work before class and not finish your problem set. You’ll have to go back and finish the problem set eventually, but you will have been able to participate in class for that day. 
2. We _highly recommend_ working in groups. We have noticed a strong correlation between success and students who had a consistent group. We will work to help facilitate the forming of groups, but will not force students to do this. You can choose to join a group that tries to stay together throughout the course, or change who you work with each class. 
3. Explore! Tinker! We do our best to provide the resources we think you’ll need to succeed, but everyone learns differently. You may find resources that you really like, or find that you like to use the resources we provide in a different way. The important thing is that you learn the concepts and understand how to apply them in code. And remember: Google is your friend!
