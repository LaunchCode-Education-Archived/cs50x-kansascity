#Terminology
*	**Lecture:** Just watch the video for a lecture. These lectures are very high-level and introductory, without going into a lot of detail. Probably best to grab a snack and crank up the speed to 1.5x *
*	**Lecture Bite:** Read over the TA notes from a portion of a lecture, and optionally re-watch the video from that section.
* **Follow-Along:** Follow along with an Instructor as he/she implements a program. As you watch the video, make your own copy of the program. Afterwards, tinker with your copy: break it, fix it, and add a tiny feature... basically make some small changes and see what happens.
*	**Study:**Work through the interactive material on a page of CS50 Study
*	**Resource:** Some sort of additional teaching material or helpful reference material like a cheat sheet. Just check it out and be aware that it's available when you need it.
* **IDE:** CS50 IDE is a web-based "integrated development environment" that allows you to program "in the cloud," without installing any software locally. CS50 IDE provides you with your very own "workspace" (i.e., storage space) in which you can save your own files and folders (aka directories).
*	**Loops:** Allow for repetition of code until a condition is met. There are three types of loops commonly used in C: for, while, do while
*	**Studio:**Time in the classroom to answer questions about the homework, practice exercises, receive coaching and feedback, and work towards completing your problem set.
*	**Short watch:** online videos
*	**PSET:** problem set specifications
*	**Resources:** https://cs50.harvard.edu/#resources
